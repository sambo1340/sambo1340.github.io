            <p>Fremont Brewing is a neighborhood staple in Fremont, with a huge outdoor seating area that has a beer garden vibe. No matter how much they expand the seating area, the people keep coming! Expect a bit of a wait, but a delicious beer and a friendly crowd.</p>

            <p>Hale's Brewery is a great place to go for a tasty IPA (try the Supergoose!) and some really good pub food. They've been around for a while, but are definitely worth checking out - especially if you want variety, as they have many beers that are well established.</p>

            <p>Located in the heart of Capitol Hill's Pike / Pine corridor, Elysian Brewing Company is a working brewery with a full bar and great pub fare. Check it out for lunch, or stop by after work for a tasting flight - just avoid Friday or Saturday night if you want to take your time, as Elysian gets its fair share of the weekend crowd that visits Capitol Hill for the night life.</p>
